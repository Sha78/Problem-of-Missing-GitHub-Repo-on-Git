        <h1>Problem of Missing GitHub Repo on Git</h1>
   

    <article>
I made a folder with the file manager on my laptop called called project 101. 
Then I opened it up in VS Code and created an index.html doc file and myStyle.css file which was automatically placed in the 
Project 101 folder from VS Code. 
Then I dragged an image called logo.png that I had on my desktop and placed it in the Project 101 folder.
After I did that I went back into VS Code and made a blog and styled it with CSS. Everything was fine. 
Then I opened the Git Bash and typed git init so that I could initialize my folder then added it to the master branch 
on my locol machine using the git add command. 
Then I opened up my github and made a repository. From there I copied the HTTP link needed to push the Project 101 folder with it contents
to github. Right after I copied the link I typed git remote add and then pasted the link after that command in the Git Bash.     
Everything was going great until I tried to push the folder to my GitHub. 
To my dismay I got a message that said that the reposity did not exist! However, it did becasue I had just created it. 
What I learned from this experience was that when I copied the link and pasted it in the git bash there was another folder 
that was created in the folder that I was in. It was that folder I needed to have the files that were in my Project 101 folder 
in order to push them to the repository I amde in GitHub. Being new to Github and Git I decided that I would move all of the files
in my Project 101 folder and put it in the folder that Github created on my laptop and do the git add git commit and git push again. 
To my amazment that worked and it was the solution to the problem of Github not finding my Folder.  
added the Project 101 folder with all of its contents
